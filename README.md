# ECSS Infrastructure

A meta repository storing config files for the running of all ECSS related services on our VM.

## Why?

The main reason for this repository is to version control our docker-compose.yaml file. This file is what is
responsible for the majority of our infrastructure and this respository allows us to version control
that infrastructure. It is our attempt at IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

## What does this repo contain

- The docker compose file
- Configs for services that we run
